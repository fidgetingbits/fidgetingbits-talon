# fidgetingbits Talon Repo

Please read the WARNING section before you use this repo, as using some of
the stuff I have may break your talon experience as I only test this repo on my
own environment, and you should avoid reporting these problems to aegis or
talon, without first validating that a repo like
[community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) works properly first.

This repo is fairly thoroughly tested on both Linux (i3wm and Gnome) and Mac
(Sonoma). Linux functionality has only been tested on Arch Linux and NixOS.

I use the beta version of Talon so this may result in errors related to
functionality if you aren't using it. I highly recommend paying for beta on
[patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs?) if you can.

In general I try to keep merging the core features from knausj_talon repo, but
sometimes it might be months behind.

# My Setup

## Arch Linux

## NixOS

## Mac

## Interesting features

Following in the steps of [Andreas
Arvidsson](https://github.com/AndreasArvidsson/andreas-talon) the following is
a list of interesting stuff in is repo that you might want take.

1. _vim_ The main feature I added that most people come to this repo for is vim support.
   See `apps/vim/` for more details.

## Other stuff

1. _run_talon.sh_ A [script](https://gist.github.com/fidgetingbits/cfc1699da2e8a60533db6c4cfdf390c3) I use to run talon that auto-restarts on stalls.
2. _talon-python-command-server_ - Talon file-based [RPC server](https://github.com/fidgetingbits/talon-python-command-server)

## WARNING

I only test this repository on my own system. Although other people are using
it, they may have similar environments to me. It's very possible that you will
run into problems using this repository that aren't actually problems with
talon, in which case you should investigate using knausj_talon first, before
reporting the problems on slack to ease the support load on others.

## Dependencies

My working environment is largely centered around:

- arch linux
- i3-gaps
- dunst
- rofi
- kitty
- neovim
- firefox
- Tobii 5

It is possible I tweak things that end up only working on this environment, and
break on either Linux systems. That said, if you run into a problem using my
repo I'm more than happy to fix it to make it more generic, I just don't do
this type of proactive testing on my own due to lack of time.

### Monkey Patching

There are a few features that I don't like the way they work on i3, so I choose
to monkey patch them. These patches may break on your system, in you need to
test a different repo first if you run into problems, before assuming its
a talon problem.

Currently the list of [monkey
patches](https://github.com/fidgetingbits/knausj_talon/blob/master/monkey/monkey_patching.py)
are:

- [notify-send.sh](https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh) - Use dunst for notifications instead of Qt
- [i3-msg](https://build.i3wm.org/docs/i3-msg.html) - Allows window focusing on i3

## Recommendations

Although not Talon specific, I recommend using
[howdy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Howdy) if you are using Linux. It
makes things like logging in and sudo authentication a lot more seamless.

## Pull requests

Even though I use this repo mostly for personal stuff, I'm happy to take pull
requests from people that find issues specifically in my changes that don't
directly applied to knausj_talon.
